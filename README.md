# RedditAPIServer
### Overview
This project was made to expose a single endpoint using node.js. This program reads a website, in this case reddit.com/r/space,
and returns posts that relevant to a search term chosen by the user.

### How to Setup
Clone this repository and install nodejs or npm. Run the following lines to run the server:<br />
`nodejs server.js`<br />
or<br />
`npm run server`<br />

### Localhost
The server is hosted on localhost:8080/redditer/(search). In order to actually make use of the program, type in any word in the
(search) parameter to have relevant posts loaded.
